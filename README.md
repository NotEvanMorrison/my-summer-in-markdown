## Topic 2 - Summer Activities:
- **This summer I went on two large, week long trips.**
    - The first was my **Boy Scout Camp where** I spent the week **camping** in the mountains while learning new skills and trying to earn merit badges. 
    - The second was a **college trip** where I spent the week in a **UCSB** dorm, learning about their different classes as well as working on different intership progams there.

## Topic 3 - Favorite Summer Food:
- This summer my grandparents came into town and we made **homemade gnocchi pasta**. We put them in an **alfredo sauce**, it was delicious as well as an amazing memory. 
    - If you would like to try the same alfredo sauce we used, you can follow this recipe.

## Topic 4 - New Skill Learned:
- This summer, I learned a lot of new things, but the greatest skill that I learned was **how to shuffle a deck of cards**. I always admired how cool it looked to swiftly reorganize the cards and I ended up asking my mom how to do it.Â She taught me how to shuffle them **in a single afternoon**, but also taught me how to add some flare for when I shuffle.

## Topic 5 - Creative Endeavors
- This summer I needed to earn a new merit badge for boyscouts, which was my woodcarving badge. So I chose to carve a **wooden** ring,** I spent several hours meticulously carving a piece of wood to be small enough to fit on my finger. 
    - *It ended up very nice and I made a second one for a friend later.*
