## Topic 4 - New Skill Learned:
- I had many new experiences this summer but the main skill that I learned was how to shuffle a deck of cards. I always admired how cool it looked to swiftly reorganize the cards and I ended up asking my mom how to do it. She taught me how to shuffle them in a single afternoon and also taught me how to add some flare to when I am shuffling them.
